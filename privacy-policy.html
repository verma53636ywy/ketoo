We have established this Privacy Policy to let you know the kinds of information we may gather during your use of this Service, why we gather your information, what we use your information for, when we might disclose your information, and how you can manage your information.&nbsp; By using our Service, you are accepting the practices described in our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Service. &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>What Information About You Is Collected and Stored?</strong></p>
<p>We collect two basic types of information from you in conjunction with your use of the Service, information you give us and information we collect from you automatically.</p>

<p>We do not require you to provide any information directly in order to access our Services. However, you may be asked to provide details such as name, email address, and physical address when you undertake the following actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registration for an account on the Services</li>
<li>Responding to an offer on the Services</li>
<li>Profile information that you provide for your user profile</li>

<li>Any other place on the Service where you knowingly volunteer personal information, such as when you place an order, upload content, or provide your e-mail address</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Information</em><em> We Collect from You Automatically</em></p>
<p>When you interact with the Services, we may collect certain information about your use of the Services. Generally, we automatically collect and store the following categories of information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Device information about your computer, browser, mobile device, or other device that you use to access the Service. This information may include IP address, unique device identifiers, browser type, and browser language</li>
<li>Additional "traffic data" such as time of access, date of access, software crash reports, session identification number, access times, and referring website addresses.</li>
</ul>
<p>Much of this information is collected through "cookies", which are small text files that are stored on your computer or equipment when you visit certain online pages that record your preferences and actions. We use cookies to monitor traffic, improve the Services and make it easier and/or relevant for your use (for example, to identify your likely home airport to facilitate the use of our trip search engine).</p>
<p>KetoUltra also works with a variety of advertisers, advertising networks, advertising servers, and marketing analytics companies. These parties use various tracking technologies, and technologies from third-party companies, including Facebook, Google, and other social media to collect data in order to send and serve relevant advertising to users.&nbsp; These technologies may be used to track user behavior and serve you more relevant advertising, both on our Services and other websites that you visit.&nbsp; This privacy policy does not cover the collection, use, and storage practices of third parties who set tracking cookies on our website.</p>
<p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but, if you prefer, you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies. If you delete your cookies or if you set your web browser to decline cookies, some features of the Sites may not work or may not work as designed. For more information on cookies and how to disable them, you can consult the information provided by the Interactive Advertising Bureau at&nbsp;<span><a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.allaboutcookies.org</a></span>.</p>

We will only collect and store such information that we are permitted to collect by the terms of service and privacy policies of these social media platforms.</p>
